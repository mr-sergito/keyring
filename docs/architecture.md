# Keyring Architecture

This document describes the overall architecture and design decisions for the Keyring project.

## System Overview

Keyring is designed to securely store application secrets for local development. It provides both a library interface for programmatic access and a CLI for manual management.

## Component Design

### Storage Layer

The storage layer is responsible for:
- Determining the appropriate location to store secrets based on the operating system
- Ensuring directory structures exist
- Reading and writing encrypted data
- Maintaining proper file permissions

Platform-specific storage locations:
- **Linux**: `~/.local/share/keyring/`
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/keyring/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\keyring\`

### Cryptography Module

The cryptography module handles:
- Encrypting secrets before storage
- Decrypting secrets when requested
- Deriving encryption keys from the master password
- Secure handling of keys and sensitive data in memory

Security considerations:
- Using industry-standard encryption algorithms (ChaCha20-Poly1305)
- Proper key derivation with salting and iteration (PBKDF2)
- Memory safety practices for sensitive data

### API Layer

The API layer provides:
- A simple, consistent interface for applications to store and retrieve secrets
- Abstraction over the storage and cryptography details
- Organized namespacing for different applications or services

Example API (simplified):
```rust
// Store a secret
keyring.set("api_key", "1234567890", "my_service");

// Retrieve a secret
let api_key = keyring.get("api_key", "my_service")?;
```

### CLI Interface

The command-line interface:
- Provides commands for managing secrets (add, get, list, delete)
- Handles user input securely (especially for passwords)
- Displays information in a readable format
- Supports both interactive and scripted usage

## Data Flow

### Storing a Secret

1. User/application calls `set("key_name", "secret_value", "service_name")`
2. System prompts for master password (if not cached)
3. Encryption key is derived from master password
4. Secret value is encrypted
5. Encrypted data is stored in the appropriate location

### Retrieving a Secret

1. User/application calls `get("key_name", "service_name")`
2. System prompts for master password (if not cached)
3. System retrieves encrypted data from storage
4. Encryption key is derived from master password
5. Secret value is decrypted and returned

## Security Model

- **Trust Boundary**: Local user account
- **Threat Model**: Protection against unauthorized local access
- **Protection Mechanism**: Encryption with master password
