# Keyring ðŸ”‘

A Rust library for securely managing application secrets during local development.

## Description

Keyring provides a secure way to store and retrieve sensitive information such as:
- API keys
- Database credentials
- OAuth tokens
- Environment-specific configuration
- Other development secrets

Rather than hardcoding these values or storing them in plain text files, Keyring encrypts them locally and provides a simple interface for your applications to access them.
